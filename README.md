# 620-P3-Starter
- Open CodeSpaces for this repo under Code, in the Codespaces tab. Click the green button to create and open the new Codespace.
- This should open a new browser tab containing a VSCode window.  After a few minutes, you should see a command line prompt at the bottom, in the terminal window.
- Because Project 3 is a continuation of Project 2, the easiest way to proceed would be to copy the final contents of your Project 2 repository into this one, including all of the project 2 Django files.  DO NOT RENAME YOUR ORIGINAL DJANGO PROJECT DIRECTORY NAME.  IT IS OKAY IF THE NAME OF YOUR DJANGO PROJECT REMAINS PROJECT2.
- To copy your content from your origninal Project 2 repository, navigte to that repository within the GitHub web interface and then use the Code > Local > Download Zip feature.
cd ..
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push
```
- It is very important that you do regular commits and pushes to avoid losing any work-in-progress.
- 
- Proceed with implementing the rest of the Project 3 features.
- Note: Codespaces will timeout after a period of inactivity.  If this happens, you can restore your previous session by reopening your codespace within the github web interface, in the same place you created your codespace.
- Tip:  If you need to prevent your Codespace session timing out, you can run this command to keep it alive:
```bash
while true; do echo "Preventing timeout..."; sleep 60; done
```
